### Apache HTTP Server with authentication on share creation
```
sudo a2enmod ssl proxy proxy_http
```
```
/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-share.conf
```
```
ServerName share.<domain>

<VirtualHost *:80>
        Redirect permanent / https://share.<domain>
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
	SSLEngine on
	SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/<cert>.pem
	SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/ssl/private/<cert>.key

	# Allow everyone to get /share (= unlock share page)
	<Location "/share">
		AuthType none
		Satisfy any
	</Location>

	# Allow everyone to get /static (= style, images and JS files)
	<Location "/static">
		AuthType none
		Satisfy any
	</Location>

	# Require an authentication for everything else like /secret and /files (= create shares)
	# The authentication can be anything (basic auth, OIDC etc...)
	<Location "/">
		AuthType Basic
		AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
		Require valid-user
	</Location>

	ProxyPreserveHost On
	ProxyRequests On
	ProxyPass / http://0.0.0.0:8080/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://0.0.0.0:8080/
</VirtualHost>
```
```
sudo a2ensite 001-share.conf
```

## Disclaimer
OpenPGP is used to cipher the password of a share when unlocking. It doesn't cipher anything else (like file download for example), please consider using HTTPS with a TLS certificate.
